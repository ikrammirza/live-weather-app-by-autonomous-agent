# 🌤️ Live Weather App (Built via Autonomous Agent Workflow)

This project is a simple Node.js application that fetches real-time weather data for London using the **Open-Meteo API** and generates a formatted `report.txt`.

The unique aspect of this project is not just the app itself — but **how it was built**.

It was fully developed through an autonomous agent workflow using Claude Code CLI routed through a local orchestration proxy.

## 🚀 What This App Does

- Fetches live weather data for London (51.5074°N, -0.1278°W)
- Uses Open-Meteo API (no API key required)
- Converts WMO weather codes into human-readable conditions
- Generates a timestamped `report.txt`
- Runs as a simple Node.js script

---

## 🧠 How It Was Built (Agentic Workflow)

The entire project lifecycle was executed through an AI agent:

- Created project folder
- Initialized npm project
- Configured ES modules (`"type": "module"`)
- Wrote the weather fetching script
- Executed and validated output
- Initialized Git repository
- Renamed branch to `main`
- Pushed to GitHub

All from a single high-level instruction.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Claude Code CLI
↓
Antigravity Proxy (localhost:8080)
↓
Upstream Model Backend
↓
Agent executes terminal commands + file operations

## 
The proxy layer handled:

- Hybrid account distribution  
- Rate limit handling (`429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`)  
- Capacity errors (`503 MODEL_CAPACITY_EXHAUSTED`)  
- Account validation issues (`403 VALIDATION_REQUIRED`)  

This allowed uninterrupted execution under real-world constraints.

💡 Key Takeaways

This project demonstrates:

Autonomous agent-driven development

CLI-based orchestration

Error recovery under quota and capacity constraints

Infrastructure-aware AI workflows

End-to-end Git lifecycle automation

The goal was not just to build a weather app —
but to explore resilient agentic system design.
